# riptide_onboarding

Onboarding tutorials for the Underwater Robotics Team.

## Overview of `riptide_turtle`

The `riptide_turtle` package is a set of tutorials designed to introduce new team members to the basics of ROS 2 using the `turtlesim` simulation. This package covers essential concepts such as:

- Creating and managing ROS 2 nodes
- Publishing and subscribing to topics
- Utilizing ROS 2 parameters for dynamic control
- Implementing services for interaction and control
- Building an understanding of ROS 2's architecture and its application to more complex robotics systems

To get started on `riptide_turtle` go into `src\riptide_turtle` and read the README. The Python files are already in `src\riptide_turtle\src` and need to be modified.

These tutorials provide a hands-on approach, ensuring that team members gain practical experience in setting up and working with ROS 2 nodes, which are fundamental to the software stack used in the Underwater Robotics Team's projects.
